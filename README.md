A simple Python program that replicates Hangman. The player attempts to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined word bank, one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn. If the figure is completed before the word is fully guessed, the player loses the game.

Project Goals:
- Separate the word bank into a .txt file so that players can remove words and add their own.
- Create a unique animation that triggers when the player wins
