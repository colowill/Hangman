## Hangman
A simple Python program that replicates Hangman. The player attempts to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined word bank, one letter at a time. Each incorrect guess results in a part of a stick figure being drawn. If the figure is completed before the word is fully guessed, the player loses the game.

Project Goals:

	 • Separate the word bank into a .txt file so that players can remove words and add their own.
	 • Create a unique animation that triggers when the player wins
	 • Create unique game rules for different difficulty options

## How to Play

	1. In terminal, clone repo to your desired location
	2. Run `python Hangman.py`
	3. Try to guess letters one a time to reveal the word indicated by blank spaces
